# Chaff: A Stubble Market Place

Chaff is a web-based platform that connects farmers with manufacturers to create a marketplace for agricultural stubble. Our mission is to empower farmers and manufacturers by creating a sustainable ecosystem for stubble management, reducing waste, and promoting economic growth. By turning agricultural waste into a valuable resource, Chaff helps reduce pollution, boosts incomes for farmers, and provides a sustainable source of raw materials for manufacturers.
